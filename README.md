# collapsible-markdown-headers README

As a power user of VSCode, I use it extensively for creating markdowns to help with my current research and other day to day tasks. Thus I have created an extension for VSCode named "collapsible-markdown-headers".

## Features

This extension provides a command that can insert the required snippet for converting any text collapsible. 

I prefer to use it with headers and subheaders.

Command flow is as follows:

text selected? create collapsible with the text as summary.
otherwise extract text from line above and use as summary

## Requirements

No requirements/dependencies.

## Extension Settings


This extension contributes the following settings:

* `extension.collapse_header`:	Collapse Markdown Header


## Known Issues

Selects only the first word from the line above.

## Release Notes

For local use, without any future plans of integration in the market.

**Enjoy!**
